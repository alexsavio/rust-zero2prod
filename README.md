# From zero to production in Rust

Check the Justfile for the commands to run the project.

## TODO:

- [ ] Subscription confirmation should not be a GET request, but a POST request: https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/zero-to-production/issues/187. At the moment, the API has a POST request to avoid extending the issue, however the confirmation email link would not work as it is a GET request. This should be fixed.

### Section 7

- [ ] What happens if a user tries to subscribe twice? Make sure that they receive two confirmation emails;
- [ ] What happens if a user clicks on a confirmation link twice?
- [ ] What happens if the subscription token is well-formatted but non-existent?
- [ ] Add validation on the incoming token, we are currently passing the raw user input straight into a query (thanks sqlx for protecting us from SQL injections <3);
- [ ] Use a proper templating solution for our emails (e.g.Â tera);
- [ ] Anything that comes to your mind!


## Troubleshooting

### Too many open files when running tests

On MacOS, you may encounter the error `Too many open files` when running tests. This is because the default limit of open file descriptors is too low. You can increase the limit by running the following command:

```sh
ulimit -n 2048
```
